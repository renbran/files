## 🚨 Critical Issues

### Issue #1: Lead Assignment Broken
```
78.31% of leads → "CRM System" (not real agents)
 │
 ├─ No personal ownership
 ├─ Delayed response times
 └─ Lower conversion rates

ACTION: Implement automatic agent assignment IMMEDIATELY
```

### Issue #2: Conversion Crisis
```
For every 100 leads:
  78 → DEAL LOST ❌
  21 → IN PROCESS ⏳
   1 → CLOSED ✅

TARGET: Get to 3-5 CLOSED per 100 leads
```

### Issue #3: Volume vs Quality Mismatch
```
FACEBOOK: 56% of volume → 15% success rate
                 ↓
         WASTING RESOURCES

PROPERTYFINDER: 1% of volume → 90% success rate
                       ↓
              UNDERUTILIZED
```
